//Homework Week 1: Currency (Programming Challenges #13)
//
//This program is to convert $100.00 US dollars(USD) to current rate of exchange 
//for the following currencies Zambia, Belize, and Hong Kong.
//
//The rate of exchange I used as a reference was found at the following website,
//http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1&From=USD&To=BZD
//The following rate of exchange for each country is shown below...
//1.00 USD (US Dollar) = 1.99169 BZD (Belizean Dollar)
//1.00 USD (US Dollar) = 7.75491 HKD (Hong Kong Dollar)
//1.00 USD (US Dollar) = 10.0546 ZMW (Zambian Kwacha)
