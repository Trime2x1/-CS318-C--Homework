//Homework Week 1: Stock Transaction Program (programming Challenges #23)
//
//This program will display the following categories for stock transactions...
// * The amount of money Joe paid for the stock.
// * The amount of commission Joe paid his broker when he bought the stock.
// * The amount that Joe sold the stock for.
// * The amount of commission Joe paid his broker when he sold the stock.
// * Display the amount of profit that Joe made after selling his stock and paying
//   the two commissions to his broker. (If the amount of profit that your program
//   displays is a negative number, then Joe lost money on the transaction.)
